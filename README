Determines IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) version 1 content identifiers.

Operates only on bytes using the following algorithm:

        1. Determine the DAG-PB  encoding.
        2. Determine the SHA-256 hash.
        3. Prepend bytes.
        4. Determine the base 32 encoding.
        5. Prepend a character.

See the source code and other IPFS resources for further details.
